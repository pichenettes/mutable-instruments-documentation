In an older printed version of this manual, in the Patch ideas section, the > TIME parameter is incorrectly referred to as POSITION . Installation Beads requires a -12V/+12V power supply (2x5 pin connector). The red stripe of the ribbon cable (-12V side) must be oriented on the same side as the \u201cRed stripe\u201d marking on the module and on your power distribution board. The module draws 100mA from the +12V rail, and 10mA from the -12V rail. Beads in a nutshell One way of picturing how Beads operates is to imagine a tape loop, on which incoming audio is continuously recorded. Every time you request a grain to be played (in reaction to a trigger, a button press, periodically, or randomly), a new replay head positions itself along the tape . If this replay head doesn\u2019t move, the audio will be played back at the original pitch and speed, but if it moves closer to, or further away from the record head, the signal will be replayed at a different speed and pitch. This replay head has its own amplitude envelope , and it will leave the tape once the envelope has reached a null amplitude. Now imagine up to 30 replay heads flying along the tape. Imagine you can stop the incoming audio from being record- ed on the tape so that all these little replay heads can freely move along and gather sounds. And there\u2019s a reverb ... Beads does not use tape, but RAM. In this manual we use computer-science terminology and refer to this virtual piece of tape as a recording buffer . Recording quality and audio input Recording quality is chosen with the selector button [A] . The Cold digital setting most accurately reproduces the sonic character of the late Mutable Instruments Clouds. The Sunny tape setting runs the dry audio signal at a bright and clean 48kHz. The Scorched cassette setting emulates wow and flutter. Beads operates in mono or stereo depending on whether one, or both, of the audio inputs (1) are patched. When patch cables are inserted or removed, Beads monitors for five seconds the level of the incoming signal and adjusts the input gain accordingly, from +0dB to +32dB. The input level LED (2) blinks during this adjustment process. The input gain is chosen to leave some headroom, but in case of big level changes, a limiter kicks in. One can manually restart the gain adjustment process by pressing and holding the audio quality selector button [A] for one second. Holding this button [A] while turning the feedback knob [J] allows manual gain adjustments. The manually-set gain is memorized and applied until a long press on [A] re-enables automatic gain control. The FREEZE latching button [B] and the corresponding gate input (3) disable the recording of the incoming audio signal in the buffer. Otherwise, Beads records continuously! If FREEZE remains engaged for more than 10 seconds, the content of the buffer is backed up, and will be restored the next time the module is powered on. Beads will not switch between stereo and mono operation, or change the recording quality, while FREEZE is engaged. Grain generation Latched Latched grain generation is enabled by holding the SEED button [C] for four seconds, or by pressing the FREEZE button [B] while the SEED button [C] is being held. This is also the default setting when the module is powered on. The SEED button remains illuminated, and its brightness is slowly modulated to indicate that latching is enabled. In this mode, the grains are generated continuously, at a rate set by the DENSITY knob [D] and modulated by the DENSITY CV input (5) . At 12 o\u2019clock, no grains are generated. Turn DENSITY CW and grains will be generated at a randomly modulated rate , or CCW for a constant generation rate . The further you turn, the shorter the interval between grains, reaching at the extreme the period of a C3 note. Clocked When latched grain generation is enabled, and when a signal, such as a clock or sequence, is patched into the SEED input (4) , the DENSITY knob [D] is repurposed as a divider or probability control. At 12 o\u2019clock, no grains are generated. Turn CW to increase the probability (from 0% to 100%) that a grain is triggered by the external signal. Turn CCW to increase the division ratio, from 1/16 to 1. Gated and triggered Disable latched grain generation with a short press on the SEED button [C] . Grains will then be generated only when the SEED button is held, or when a gate signal patched in the SEED input (4) is high. The DENSITY knob [D] controls the repetition rate of grains. When DENSITY is at 12 o\u2019clock, only a single grain will be played at each press of the SEED button, or at each trigger sent in the SEED input (4) . When grain density reaches audio rates, the DENSITY CV input (5) applies exponential FM on this rate, with a scale of 1V/octave Grain playback control Four parameters control at which buffer position, pitch, and with which duration and envelope the grains are replayed. More precisely, these parameters and their respective modulations are read once, whenever a grain starts , and remain unchanged throughout the duration of the grain. If a parameter then changes, it will only impact the next grain. For example, turning the PITCH knob will create a trail of grains with different pitches, rather than change, in lock-step, the pitch of all the grains that are currently playing. E. TIME controls if the grain replays the most recent (fully CCW) or oldest (fully CW) audio material from the recording buffer \u2013 shifting the replay heads further apart from the record head. F. PITCH controls the transposition, from -24 to +24 semi- tones, with virtual notches at selected intervals. G. SIZE controls the duration and playback direction of the grain. At the 11 o\u2019clock position, a very short (30ms) grain is played. Turn CW to increase grain duration up to 4s. Turn CCW to play a reversed grain, lasting up to 4s. Turning SIZE fully clockwise (\u221e) generates never-ending grains acting as delay taps. Please refer to the Beads as a delay section. H. SHAPE adjusts the amplitude envelope of the grain. Fully CCW creates clicky, rectangular envelopes, while fully CW provides envelopes with slow attacks reminiscent of reversed grains (Please note, however, that the envelope shape is independent of the playback direction). I. Attenurandomizers for the TIME, SIZE, SHAPE and PITCH parameters. They control the amount of external CV modu- lation on the corresponding parameters, or repurpose the CV input (6) as a randomization or spread control. Attenurandomizers When a cable is patched into the corresponding CV input (6) , turning the attenurandomizer [I] CW from 12 o\u2019clock increases the amount of external CV modulation . Turning it CCW increases the amount of CV-controlled randomization . With no CV patched into an input, the attenurandomizer controls the amount of randomization from an independent internal random source with a peaky (12 o\u2019clock to fully CCW) or uniform (12 o\u2019clock to fully CW) distribution. The random values from the peaky distribution are clustered towards the middle, with extreme values being infrequently generated. Patch ideas Patch a ramp-down LFO, or a decaying linear envelope into the TIME CV input for \"scrubbing\" the buffer, or a segment of it, at whichever speed the LFO rate or envelope time is set to. Timestretching time! The PITCH CV input tracks V/O when the attenurandomizer is turned fully CW: one can sequence a melody of grains or even play them from a keyboard. Patch a fast arpeggiated sequence into the PITCH CV input to create chords: each grain will be played at a randomly chosen note of the arpeggio. Sequence slices of sound (or phonemes from a recording of speech) by patching the CV output of a sequencer into TIME , and its gate output into SEED . Mixing and audio output J. Feedback , that is to say the amount of output signal mixed with the input signal and fed back into the processing chain. Each quality setting employs a different feedback amplitude limiting scheme typical of the medium it emulates \u2013 from clean brickwall-limiting to grungy tape saturation. K. Dry/wet balance. L. Amount of reverb . Modeled on the acoustics of Thoreau\u2019s cabin, or of a strip-mall spa. The LED under each of these knobs indicates the amount of modulation they receive from the assignable CV input (7) . Press the button [M] to select to which of these 3 destinations the CV input (7) is assigned. Or hold this button and turn the knobs [J] , [K] and [L] to individually adjust the amount of CV modulation. 8. Audio output. While the recording buffer can be mono or stereo, Beads\u2019 signal processing chain is always stereo. If the R output is left unpatched, both L and R signals are summed together and sent to the L output. If one of the grains\u2019 parameters is randomized, or if the grains are generated at a random rate, their pan position will also be randomized. Hold the button [M] and press the SEED button [C] to enable (or disable) the generation of a grain trigger signal on the R output. A patch cable will have to be inserted in the R output for this to work without affecting the L output! Beads as a delay Setting the grain SIZE [G] knob fully clockwise (\u221e) turns Beads into a delay or beat slicer . Effectively, only one grain remains active, forever, continuously reading from the tape. The base delay time (and slice duration) can be manually controlled, tapped, or set by an external clock. Manual control If the SEED input (4) is left unpatched, and if the SEED button [C] is latched (slowly fading in and out), the delay time is freely controlled by the DENSITY knob [D] and CV input (5) . At 12 o\u2019clock, the base delay time corresponds to the full buffer duration . Turn the knob further away to shorten the delay time up to audio rates , for flanger or comb-filtering effects. From 12 o\u2019clock to fully CW, the delay will have an additional, unevenly spaced, tap. Clocked or tap-tempo control If an external clock is patched into the SEED input (4) , or if you rhythmically tap the SEED button, the base delay time will be set as the interval between the taps or clock ticks. The DENSITY knob [D] selects a subdivision of this duration. Turn the knob further away from 12 o\u2019clock to use shorter subdivisions. From 12 o\u2019clock to fully CCW, only binary subdivisions will be used. From 12 o\u2019clock to fully CW, a wider variety of ratios are available. Delaying or slicing When FREEZE [B] is not engaged, Beads operates as a delay. The TIME knob [E] selects the actual delay time, as a multiple of the base delay time set by DENSITY and/or by the external clock or taps. When FREEZE [B] is engaged, a slice from the recording buffer is continuously looped. The duration of a slice is equal to the base delay time. The TIME knob [E] selects which slice is played. The SHAPE knob [H] applies a tempo-synchronized envelope on the repeats. For normal operation, turn it fully CCW. PITCH [F] applies a classic rotary-head pitch-shifting effect on the delayed signal. At 12 o\u2019clock, the pitch-shifter is bypassed. Slow random LFOs are internally routed to the attenurandomizers [I] . Beads as a granular wavetable synth When both audio inputs (1) are left unpatched, and at the end of a period of ten seconds, Beads loses patience and granularizes a collection of internally stored buffers of raw waveforms from Mutable Instruments Plaits\u2019 wavetable model. The feedback control [J] selects which one of these 8 banks of waveforms is played. The dry/wet control [K] adjusts the balance between the continuous oscillator signal, and the granularized signal. The FREEZE button [B] halts the envelope of the grains, and stops the generation of new grains. The audio quality selector [A] selects the output resolution. Finally, the PITCH CV input always acts as a 1 V/octave CV input affecting the root note of the grains, irrespectively of the position of the PITCH attenurandomizer. The PITCH attenurandomizer always controls the amount of pitch randomization of the grains. Advanced topics Firmware update procedure If you think your module is behaving strangely, updating the firmware is certainly not the right thing to do. Unplug all CV inputs/outputs from the module. Connect the output of your audio interface/sound card to the IN L input (1) . Set the TIME knob [E] to an intermediate position. Power on your modular system with the FREEZE illuminated push-button (B) pressed. Make sure that no additional sound (such as email notification sounds, background music etc.) from your computer will be played during the procedure. Make sure that your speakers/monitors are not connected to your audio interface - the noises emitted during the procedure are aggressive and can harm your hearing. On non-studio audio equipment (for example the line output from a desktop computer), you might have to turn up the gain to the maximum. When you are all set, play the firmware update file into the module. While the module receives data, the recording quality LED [A] will act as vu-meter (lit in yellow when the signal level is optimal). Try adjusting the TIME knob to adjust gain. When the end of the audio file is reached, the module automatically restarts - if it is not the case, please retry the procedure from the beginning. In case the signal level is inadequate, all LEDs will blink in red. Press the button [B] and retry with a higher gain. If this does not help, please retry the procedure from another computer/audio interface, and make sure that no piece of equipment or software effect (equalizer, automatic gain control, FX processor) is inserted in the signal chain.","title":"Manual"},{"location":"modules/beads/manual/#oops","text":"In an older printed version of this manual, in the Patch ideas section, the > TIME parameter is incorrectly referred to as POSITION .","title":"Oops!"},{"location":"modules/beads/manual/#installation","text":"Beads requires a -12V/+12V power supply (2x5 pin connector).

Carries a blend of filter 1 and filter 2\u2019s outputs, depending on the ROUTING knob and CV. Controlling the signal path The ROUTING knob [G] acts as a dual crossfader. Firstly, it controls which proportion of filter 1 and filter 2\u2019s output is sent to the MAIN output (6) : only filter 1 when turned fully CCW, only filter 2 when turned fully CW, and a mix of both filters at 12 o\u2019clock. Secondly, it also controls which proportion of filter 1\u2019s input and filter 1\u2019s output is sent to filter 2\u2019s input (provided filter 2\u2019s IN is left unpatched). As a result, the following filter configurations can be obtained: Single: the MAIN output carries the output of filter 1. Parallel: the MAIN output carries a mix of filter 1 and filter 2\u2019s outputs, and both filters process the same signal from filter 1\u2019s input. Series: the MAIN output carries the output of filter 2, which processes filter 1\u2019s output. If you patch your own signal source into filter 2\u2019s input, then the ROUTING control simply acts as a crossfader between filter 1 and 2\u2019s outputs. Tips and patch ideas Patch filter 2\u2019s output into filter 1\u2019s FREQUENCY CV input and vice-versa for some chaotic effects. Use filter 1 in self-oscillation as an oscillator (possibly with feedback from its own output to its FREQUENCY input to bend its waveform). Use filter 2 to wavefold and filter this raw waveform. When a filter self-oscillates, and thus behaves as a sine oscillator, its phase can be modulated through the MODE CV input. This allows the synthesis of metallic tones reminiscent of FM. Try modulating MODE through a VCA, for CV-controlled adjustment of phase-modulation depth. With the two filters in series, both set to a low-pass response, the module can be used as a voltage-con- trolled distortion with pre- and post- tone controls. Set filter 1 to a mild DRIVE , low FREQUENCY and RESO , and choose the high-pass response. The ROUTING knob now acts as a dry/wet control, for whatever function filter 2 performs. The intermediate responses between LP and BP, or BP and HP, have a shelving shape. This can turn Blades into a useful tool for EQ-ing and spectrally coloring signals. Since Blades \u2019 signal path is DC-coupled you can also use it to process CV signals: use FREQUENCY for portamento, RESO to add overshoot and wiggles.

The red stripe of the ribbon cable (-12V side) must be oriented on the same side as the \"Red stripe\" marking on the board. The module draws 70mA from the -12V rail and 70mA from the +12V rail. Current consumption can reach 90mA on either rail depending on the color and brightness of the LEDs. Overview and signal flow Blinds is a 4-channel voltage-controlled signal polarizer. Each channel consists of a polarizer circuit, also known as a four-quadrant multiplier. This circuit acts like a VCA, except that a negative control voltage will cause the output signal to be inverted, instead of being silenced. Blinds' outputs are daisy-chained, allowing adjacent groups of 2, 3, or all 4 channels, to be mixed together. Controls, inputs and outputs A. Channel polarity and gain. At 12 o'clock, the channel is muted. Turn clockwise to amplify, turn counter-clock- wise to amplify and invert. B. Modulation attenuverter. Adjusts the amount and polarity of modulation from the modulation input (2), i.e. how much, and in which direction, the channel polarity and gain will wiggle around the central value set by A. 1. Signal input. Blinds' inputs are DC-coupled and accept both audio and CV signals. This input receives +5V when no patch cable is inserted. 2. Modulation input. This input is also DC-coupled. When audio-rate signals are present on both the signal and modulation input, Blinds works as a pure ring-modulator. 3. Signal output. When no patch cable is plugged into an output, the signal from this channel is routed to the next channel. For example, when no patch cable is patched into output 1, output 2 will contain the sum of channel 2 and channel 1.

Random bits Output equation The following equation describes the operation performed by each channel: Where Vout is the output voltage, Vin the input voltage, Vmod the control voltage, BigKnob and SmallKnob the position of the big and small knobs, represented as a number between -1 and 1 (0 being the 12 o'clock position). Because Vin is normalized to +5V, when nothing is patched into Vin , this equation becomes: In this case, the big knob controls an offset between -5V and +5V, and the small knob a gain between -1 and +1. In other word, each channel of Blinds can be used as an attenuverter with offset control circuit. Use as a ring modulator A ring modulator is an imperfect four-quadrant multiplier realized with a diode ring circuit. Because it is based on a bipolar VCA circuit, Blinds realizes a purer sounding version of ring-modulation, very close to the mathematical ideal of signal multiplication. Don't worry though, the familiar sounds of bells, american metaphysical circuses and Daleks are still there! When Blinds is used as a ring modulator, with audio rate signals going in both inputs, the big knob controls a very interesting parameter: carrier rejection (how much of the unmodulated signal will \"bleed\" on top of the ring-modulated signal). Zeroing a channel Because of mechanical backlash in the construction of the potentiometer, the vertical mark on the panel might not be perfectly aligned with the white pointer of the knob when a channel has zero offset. In addition, some envelope generators or LFO might have a residual \"bleed\" voltage - they sometimes sit a few mV below 0 after their release.

As a result, the sound quality of these models has been improved. The generated waveforms are crisper, with a more consistent amplitude, and less aliasing. Increased the range of the TIMBRE and COLOR settings on the CSAW model. It is still possible to synthesize the CS-80 \"sawtooth with a notch\" waveform of the previous revisions, but this model now covers a larger range of saw/square hybrid tones. Added a new synthesis model, HARM , which generates a mixture of sine harmonics. COLOR modifies the distribution of the amplitudes of each harmonics, around a central frequency set by TIMBRE . Improved the quality of the Z?PF models when they are played with fast envelopes, by adding linear interpolation to the TIMBRE parameter. Improved the quality of the VFOF model. Removed some of the \"clickiness\" of the built-in VCA. Improved the DRFT setting, which generates analog-style frequency drifting and detuning. The random process generating the noise has a more realistic behavior; and the amount of frequency drifting can be adjusted (instead of a plain on/off switch). Reworked the SIGN setting, which was designed to give each module a unique tone coloration, and glitches, generated from its serial number. The generated curves are now more \"fuzzy\" and \"organic\"; and the amount of coloration can be adjusted (instead of a plain on/off switch). Exposed many of the parameters of the internal AD envelope. The TDST setting has been replaced by 4 new individual settings to control the amount of FM , TIMBRE , COLOR and VCA modulation from the internal AD envelope \u2013 making it dead easy to create drum sounds with Braids. The TENV setting (the preset envelope shapes with silly names) has disappeared and you can now control both the attack and decay of the internal AD. Added many scales (about 50!) to the built-in quantizer, whose code has been rewritten from scratch to allow all kind of stuff not based on the 12TET system. A new setting, ROOT , selects the root note upon which the scale is built. Reversed the polarity of the output signal, so that the sawtooth wave ramps up. v1.7 Added 808 kick and snare models. Added cymbal noise model. Added triple sine and triple triangle models. v1.6 Fixed an issue causing rare glitches with the sawtooth and square modes. v1.5 Added a new TDST option to assign a behavior to the trigger input: phase reset (sync), AD timbre modulation, AD amplitude envelope, and AD timbre/amplitude modulation. Visual feedback added to the META mode. The CV-controlled model change in META mode is now relative to the current model, as selected by the encoder. v1.4 Fixed a bug that prevented the system settings to be written in memory in some situations. Added a new setting to the RANG menu that locks the output frequency to 440 Hz (useful as a reference for tuning other modules). Altered the phase and amplitude of some waveforms in the WTBL and WMAP modes to make the interpolation/scanning smoother. Added a new wavetable mode, WLIN , which allows the wavetable data to be scanned linearly by the TIMBRE control; while COLOR morphs between various interpolation methods and resolutions (between waveforms or within waveform sample data). Added a new wavetable mode, WTx4 , generating four voices of wavetable synthesis. TIMBRE morphs through a representative selection of the waveforms; while COLOR selects various intervals between the four voices (unison with detuning, octaves, chords\u2026) Added two new synthesis modes, with 3 voices of anti-aliased sawtooth or square waves. TIMBRE and COLOR control the interval/detuning of the second and third voices. Added a new synthesis model, DRUM , which is a variant of BELL generating an additive timpani-like sound. TIMBRE controls its decay, while COLOR the tone brightness. Reworked the FOLD mode to provide more destructive wavefolding on its triangle/sine internal inputs. The amount of wavefolding decreases when note frequency is increased to prevent aliasing. Reworked the FBFM mode. The range of the FM index control ( TIMBRE ) is dynamically adjusted as a function of the COLOR and main frequency settings. This allows a greater amount of destructive FM in the low and mid ranges, while keeping aliasing under control when the frequency reaches the higher octaves. v1.3 Initial release.","title":"Firmware"},{"location":"modules/braids/firmware/#download","text":"Latest version (1.8) Firmware update procedure","title":"Download"},{"location":"modules/braids/firmware/#revisions","text":"","title":"Revisions"},{"location":"modules/braids/firmware/#v18","text":"Rewrote from scratch the band-limited waveform synthesis code used in the analog waveform models (CS-80 saw, waveform morphing, square-saw morphing, sync square, triple saw, triple square).

If the settings and menus of your unit look a bit different, it's likely that an older firmware revision is installed. You can find out which version is installed by clicking on the encoder and scrolling to the end of the menu. If an older version is installed, Please upgrade! Overview Braids is a voltage-controlled digital sound source. It features 45 waveform synthesis models, which cover techniques such as FM, wavetable synthesis, waveguide synthesis or analog emulation. Most synthesis models are built with one or several oscillators connected through crossfaders, modulators, filters, or delay lines. Each synthesis model is controlled by 2 parameters, called Timbre and Color . Most of the time, Timbre will impact the brightness of the sound. Installation Braids is designed for Eurorack synthesizer systems and occupies 16 HP of space. Boards manufactured prior to july 2015 require a -12V/+12V / +5V supply (2x8 connector), and draw 15mA from the -12V/+12V rails and 85mA from the +5V rail. Boards manufactured after july 2015 require a -12V/+12V (2x5 connector), and draw 15mA from the -12V rail and 100mA from the +12V rail. In any case, the red stripe of the ribbon cable must be oriented on the same side as the \"Red stripe\" marking on the printed circuit board. Controls A : LED display and rotary encoder. When the module starts, the LED display shows the name of the active synthesis model, and the encoder can be used to select a model. Click the encoder to display a list of additional settings and options. Click the encoder to select an option and modify its value. Once the value has been modified to your liking, click the encoder to get back to the list of options. Selecting the first option (\"WAVE\"), saves to memory the current setup and brings you back in model selection mode. B, C: Fine and coarse frequency control. D : Frequency modulation attenuverter. This knob controls the amount and polarity of modulation applied to frequency, from the FM CV input jack. E : Timbre. This parameter controls the main evolution and motion of the timbre - for example pulse width for a square oscillator or modulation index for a FM model. F : Modulation attenuverter. This knob controls the amount and polarity of modulation applied to the TIMBRE parameter, from the TIMBRE CV input jack. G : Color. This knob controls a second dimension of sound, for example the symmetry of an oscillator or the modulation frequency for a FM model. Inputs and outputs TRIG : This trigger input serves three purposes. 1/ Braids' physical models need to be \"excited\" by an impulse on this input to give birth to a sound. 2/ The other models will treat the trigger as a reset signal, bringing the phase of the oscillator(s) to 0. 3/ This input can also be used to trigger an internal AD envelope applied to the parameters of your choice, to create sound animation and attacks without an external envelope module. V/OCT : 1V/Oct frequency CV input. FM : Frequency modulation CV input - the scale and polarity of this signal is set by the FM attenuverter. TIMBRE and COLOR : Control voltages for the Timbre and Color parameters. A value of 0V corresponds to the minimum position of the knob. A value of +5V corresponds to the maximum position of the knob. This CV is offset by the current position of the knob. OUT : Signal output. Loudness is model-dependent - for example a pure sine wave is always at maximum amplitude; while a ring-modulated sine-wave will have peaks and valleys due to amplitude modulation, and will thus sound quieter. Models CSAW This model is inspired by a quirk/defect of the Yamaha CS80 sawtooth wave shape, consisting of a fixed-width \"notch\" after the raising edge. The width of the notch can be controlled by TIMBRE ; and its depth and polarity can be controlled by COLOR - producing phasing effects. /\\/|-_-_ This model produces the classic waveform trajectory from triangle to sawtooth to square to pulse found in synthesizers such as the RSF Kobol or the Moog Voyager. TIMBRE sweeps through the waveforms. COLOR morphs from several tonal characters by increasingly removing the high-frequencies with a 1-pole filter, and recreating them with a waveshaper. /|/|-_-_ This model blends a sawtooth wave with dephasing control, with a square wave with PWM. TIMBRE controls the dephasing amount or pulse width, and COLOR morphs the waveshape from sawtooth to square. FOLD This model is built with sine and triangle oscillators sent into a wavefolder. TIMBRE controls the wavefolder strength, and COLOR controls the balance between the sine and triangle signals sent to it. _|_|_|_|_ This digital synthesis algorithm generates a smooth sequence of waveforms, transitioning from a sine wave to a Dirac comb, as controlled by TIMBRE . The intermediary steps are reminiscent of a single formant. Two such waveshapes are blended together, with the detuning amount controlled by COLOR . SYN-_-_ SYN/| These model synthesize the classic 2-oscillator hardsync patch, with both oscillators emitting square or saw waves. The main oscillator frequency controls the master frequency. The interval between master and slave is controlled by TIMBRE . COLOR controls the balance between the two oscillators. /|/|x3 -_-_x3 /\\x3 SIx3 Three sawtooth (or square, triangle, sine) oscillators which can be individually tuned. COLOR and TIMBRE control the relative frequency of the second and third oscillator with respect to the main oscillator. These two controls are quantized to \"snap\" on musical intervals like octaves or fifths. RING Three sine wave oscillators are ring-modulated together, and colored by a waveshaper. The main oscillator frequency controls the frequency of the first sine wave, and TIMBRE and COLOR control the relative frequency of the second and third sine waves. /|/|/|/| This model simulates a swarm of 7 sawtooth waves. TIMBRE controls their detuning, and COLOR applies a high-pass filter to the resulting sound. /|/|_|_|_ This model generates a sawtooth waveform, and sends it into a comb filter (tuned delay line). The frequency of the delay line tracks the frequency of the sawtooth oscillator, with a transposition controlled by the TIMBRE knob. COLOR selects the feedback amount and polarity: at 12 o'clock, no feedback is applied. From 12 o'clock to 5 o'clock, positive feedback is increasingly applied. From 12 o'clock to 7 o'clock, negative feedback is progressively applied. TOY* This model traverses a space of timbres typical of (circuit-bent) electronic musical toys. TIMBRE simulates an alteration of the toy's clock rate, while COLOR creates glitches or short-circuits on a converter or memory chip's data lines. ZLPF, ZPKF, ZBPF, ZHPF This family of models directly synthesize in the time-domain the response of a low-pass, peaking, band-pass or high-pass filter excited by classic analog waveforms. Rather than synthesizing the waveform and filtering it (which is what a VA synthesizer would do), this approach directly aims at building the filtered waveshape from scratch. This technique has been used in the Casio CZ or the Roland D series, but is extended here to cover different filter types and waveshapes. TIMBRE controls the cutoff frequency of the filter. COLOR continuously modifies the waveshape, from saw to square to triangle. VOSM This model uses a combination of 3 oscillators arranged in a clever ring-modulation/hardsync patch to emulate formant synthesis - a technique named VOSIM and described by Kaegi and Tempelaars. COLOR and TIMBRE control the relative frequencies of the two formants. VOWL, VFOF Both models synthesize vowel sounds. VOWL is a faithful recreation of early computer speech synthesis programs. VFOF uses a simplified version of Rodet's FOF synthesis technique. Both have the same control layout: TIMBRE controls the vowel, morphing between a, e, i, o, u. COLOR shifts the formants in frequency. Main oscillator frequency and COLOR can be used altogether to simulate age and gender transformations. HARM This model uses additive synthesis, by summing 12 sine harmonics. COLOR modifies the distribution of the amplitudes of each harmonics, around a central frequency set by TIMBRE . FM, FBFM, WTFM Three flavors of 2-operator phase-modulation synthesis. TIMBRE controls the modulation amount. COLOR controls the relative frequency interval between modulator and carrier. FM is a well-behaved implementation. FBFM uses feedback from the carrier to itself to produce harsher tones. WTFM uses two feedback paths, from carrier to modulator and carrier to itself to achieve droning, unstable tones. PLUK Raw plucked string synthesis. TIMBRE controls the damping, COLOR the plucking position. This model needs to be \"excited\" by a trigger signal. BOWD Bowed string modeling. TIMBRE controls the friction level, COLOR the bowing position. A trigger or gate signal is required. Note that this model does not include a body filter - which would be necessary to simulate an actual string instrument. BLOW, FLUTE Reed or flute instrument model. TIMBRE controls the air pressure, COLOR the geometry of the instrument. Note that this model does not include a filter - which would have been necessary to simulate an actual instrument. BELL This model established by Risset uses additive synthesis to recreate the tone of a bell. TIMBRE controls the damping of the sound; and COLOR the inharmonicity of the sound. This model needs to be \"excited\" by a trigger signal (or raising edge of a gate signal). DRUM This variant of the BELL model uses different parameters (partials frequencies and amplitudes) to generate a sound reminiscent of a metallic drum. TIMBRE controls the damping and COLOR the brightness. KICK This model is a simulation of the TR-808 bass drum circuit. TIMBRE controls the decay time, while COLOR controls the brightness (\"tone\") of the sound. The main oscillator frequency controls the tuning of the bridged-T filter. CYMB Raw material for cymbal sound synthesis, as inspired by the TR-808 circuits. COLOR controls the balance between a droning sum of square waves and noise. TIMBRE controls the cutoff of a band-pass filter applied on the resulting signal. SNAR This model is a simulation of the TR-808 snare drum circuit. TIMBRE controls the balance between the two modes of the resonator (\"tone\"), and COLOR controls the amount of noise (\"snappy\"). WTBL WTBL is a classic implementation of wavetable synthesis. TIMBRE sweeps the wavetable, and COLOR selects one of the 20 wavetables to play with. The waveforms are interpolated when traveling through a wavetable, but not when switching from one table to another. WMAP WMAP is a two-dimensional implementation of wavetable synthesis. 256 waveforms have been laid out in a 16x16 grid, so that adjacent waveforms are similar sounding. The TIMBRE parameter scans the table in the X direction, and the COLOR parameter scans the table in the Y direction, with smooth interpolation across the two directions. WLIN WLIN allows one dimensional scanning through the entirety of Braids' wavetables. TIMBRE moves through the waves, while COLOR selects the interpolation method. When COLOR is at 7 o'clock, no interpolation is applied. When COLOR is at 10 o 'clock, interpolation is applied between samples, but not between waves. When COLOR is at 12 o'clock, interpolation is always applied. When COLOR goes past 12 o'clock, interpolation is applied between waves, but the resolution of the playback resolution is decreased. WTx4 This mode is a 4-voice variant of WLIN . TIMBRE morphs through a small selection of 16 waves. COLOR selects the harmonic structures between the 4 voices - from a predefined set of chords. When COLOR is at 7 o'clock, all voices are playing the same note with a variable amount of detuning, creating a thick chorus effect. NOIS This model filters white noise with a state-variable filter. The main oscillator frequency controls the cutoff frequency of the filter. TIMBRE controls the resonance of the filter. COLOR performs a crossfade between the low-pass and high-pass outputs of the filter. TWNQ This \"Twin Peaks\" model generates white noise and process it with two band-pass filters (resonators). TIMBRE controls the Q factor of the filters, and COLOR changes their spacing. The frequency of both filters track the main frequency. CLKN This model generates random samples at a given rate, determined by the main pitch control. TIMBRE controls the periodicity of the generator (up to a 2 samples cycle), and COLOR its quantization level (from 2 distinct values to 32 distinct values). CLOU, PRTC These granular synthesis models create natural textures by mixing short grains of windowed sine waves (CLOU) or short decaying \"pings\" (PRTC). The frequency of the grains is controlled by the main frequency control, but is randomized by an amount proportional to the COLOR control. TIMBRE controls the density and overlap of the grains. QPSK This model generates - in the audio frequency range - the kind of modulated signals used in digital telecommunication systems. The main oscillator frequency is the carrier frequency. The bit-rate is controlled by the TIMBRE knob. The COLOR knob sets an 8-bit value which is modulated into the carrier using QPSK modulation. A 16-byte synchronization frame is sent on every trigger/gate, or every 256 data bytes. Options META allows the synthesis model to be selected by the FM CV. When this mode is active, frequency modulation through the FM CV input is no longer possible - but is replaced by CV-controlled model selection. This option is great for creating sequences featuring the different synthesis models. Keep in mind that discontinuities might be heard when switching from one model to the other! The EDIT encoder can still be used to scroll through synthesis models; and the CV applies to the FM input allows you to scroll forward (positive voltage) or backwards (negative voltage) in the list. BITS selects the bit-depth of the data sent to DAC. RATE selects the refresh rate of the DAC. Note that a handful of models are internally rendered at 48kHz (instead of 96kHz); so the difference between 48kHz and 96kHz might be non-existent for the most complex models. Note also that conversely, to reduce aliasing, the simplest models are rendered internally at 192kHz or 384kHz. TSRC selects a trigger source: EXT. uses the gate/trigger jack; AUTO additionally tracks changes in the V/OCT frequency input larger than a semitone and generates a trigger on each of these. This allows, for example, the physical models or the internal AD generator to be controlled by a note sequencer which does not provide gate outputs. TDLY applies a delay between the moment the trigger is received and the moment the note is \"struck\" on the physical models. We have observed that some CV-gate converters or sequencers sometimes have slow settling times, or have a short timing errors between the refresh of their analog and digital outputs. Delaying the processing of the trigger allows the physical model to sample the accurate CV rather than a fluctuating one - which can cause unwanted glitches or portamento-like effects at note onsets. |\\ATT, |\\DEC are the attack and decay time of the internal AD envelope generator. |\\FM, |\\TIM, |\\COL, |\\VCA control the amount of modulation from the internal AD envelope generator to the FM, Timbre, Color and output amplitude parameters. When all these settings are null, the TRIG input works as a sync / reset input. RANG chooses the range of the \"coarse\" knob. EXT. adjusts the range of this knob +/- 4 octaves around the note received on the V/Oct input. Because of this, when no frequency CV signal is sent to the module (which would be the equivalent to sending a CV of 0V - corresponding to a very low note!), the coarse button will have a bias towards low frequencies, which might not always be desirable. FREE adjusts the range of the coarse knob to +/- 4 octave centered around C3 (261.5 Hz). This setting is recommended when the module is used with no external signal on the V/Oct CV input. XTND (extended) provides a larger frequency range, but disables accurate V/Oct scaling as a side effect. The last option ( 440 ) locks the oscillator frequency to 440 Hz exactly - helpful for tuning another VCO. OCTV is a transposition (by octave) switch. QNTZ applies a quantification to the incoming V/OCT control voltage. The frequency can be quantized to semitones, or to one of the many available scales, or disabled. ROOT selects the root note upon which is built the quantizer's scale. FLAT applies a detuning in the lower and higher frequencies, to recreate some of the tuning imperfections of VCOs. DRFT recreates the drifting of a disastrously designed VCO. SIGN applies grungy glitches/waveform imperfections to the output signal. The exact behavior of this option is unique to each module built. BRIG adjusts the screen brightness. Calibration The module is factory-calibrated using precision voltage sources. Follow this procedure only if you want to compensate for inaccuracies in your CV sources, or if your module has lost its calibration settings following a fault or the installation of alternative firmware. To calibrate the unit, disconnect any signal from the FM input, and connect the note CV output of a well-calibrated keyboard interface or MIDI-CV converter to the V/OCT input. Move the COARSE and FINE knobs to 12 o'clock position. Go to CAL. in the options list, and keep the encoder pressed for 1s (this is not an option you want to select by mistake during a performance !). The screen displays >C2 . Send a voltage of 1V to the CV input. Click on the encoder. The screen displays >C4 . Send a voltage of 3V to the CV input. Click on the encoder to finish calibration. Because Braids uses this software calibration procedure, it is compatible with the 1.2V/Oct standard too! Here is a tip: you can very well perform the calibration procedure with another pair of notes 2 octaves apart, and with the COARSE knob in another position. This can be used to shift up or down the range of the COARSE knob. Toys Following CAL. in the menu is a screen showing a visual representation of the internal ADC readings for the TIMBRE , COLOR , V/OCT and FM inputs. This page is helpful for visualizing the polarity and range of incoming CV signals. The next option shows a scrolling line of text. TIMBRE controls the scrolling; and a gate/trigger can be used to scroll the text left by one column. To edit the text, keep the encoder pressed for more than 1s. Rotate the encoder to select the first character. Click to move to the next character and continue editing. Once the line of text has been composed, select the last character (all segments lit) to confirm. At any time, you can also hold the encoder to leave the edit mode. Firmware update procedure Unplug all CV inputs/outputs from the module. Connect the output of your audio interface/sound card to the FM input ( 3 ). Set the FINE knob ( B ) to 12 o'clock , and the FM attenuverter ( D ) to 5 o'clock. Power on your modular system with Braids' encoder pressed. The screen will show _RDY , with a \"snake\" pattern on the first character. Make sure that no additional sound (such as email notification sounds, background music etc.) from your computer will be played during the procedure. Make sure that your speakers/monitors are not connected to your audio interface - the noises emitted during the procedure are aggressive and can harm your hearing. On non-studio audio equipment (for example the line output from a Desktop computer), you might have to turn up the gain to the maximum. When you are all set, play the firmware update file into the module. The display shows the number of data packets received. The firmware contains between 90 and 112 packets, and the unit reboots after the last packet has been received. In case the signal level is inadequate, the unit will display @SYN . Try adjusting the position of the FM attenuverter, click the encoder and retry from the start of the update file. The unit displays @CRC if a data packet is corrupted. It is suggested in this case to retry the procedure from another computer/audio interface, and to make sure that no piece of equipment (equalizer, FX processor) is inserted in the signal chain.","title":"Manual"},{"location":"modules/braids/manual/#overview","text":"Braids is a voltage-controlled digital sound source.

The code (along with the hardware description files) can be found in the braids directory in our Eurorack modules git repository . After having cloned the repository, don't forget to run git submodule init && git submodule update to make sure the sub-projects referenced in the code are also pulled. Playground A simple way of testing the oscillators code locally on a desktop computer, without long flash/test cycles, is to use the command line program in braids/test. It can be built and run with make -f braids/test/makefile && ./oscillator_test . No embedded toolchain is needed for that! The program generates a .wav file, oscillator.wav . Playing with the methods of the MacroOscillator class is a good way of familiarizing oneself's with Braids code. Toolchain If you don't mind installing Vagrant and VirtualBox a cozy environment for firmware hacking is available. If you want to set up your own environment to build Braids' code, an ARM EABI toolchain must be installed. Because of tight CPU and code size limits, we recommend you to use the same compiler version as we do: 4.8-2013-q4-major . Various pre-compiled binaries and source packages are available here . The path to the toolchain binaries must be specified in the TOOLCHAIN_PATH variable in braids/makefile . To build the bootloader, use the following command: make -f braids/bootloader/makefile hex To build the code, use the following command: make -f braids/makefile If you modify lookup tables and want the big resources.cc file to be regenerated: touch braids/resources/resources.py && make -f braids/makefile resources Firmware programming A first solution is to simply use the firmware update procedure. A .wav file for firmware upgrade can be generated with: make -f braids/makefile wav The firmware can then be loaded into the module using the procedure described in the manual. Past this point, we assume you know what you are doing and we are not responsible for any damage to your module! Another solution is to use the built-in serial bootloader of the STM32F.

It creates textures and soundscapes by combining multiple overlapping, delayed, transposed and enveloped segments of sound taken from an audio recording buffer. Clouds differs from other granular Eurorack modules in that it focuses on the real-time processing of audio sources from your modular system itself, rather than the playback of pre-recorded samples from a storage device. It rewards the freezing, fragmentation and dissolution of the unexpected instant, rather than the careful planning of what might very well not come. Installation Clouds is designed for Eurorack synthesizer systems and occupies 18 HP of space. It requires a -12V/+12V supply (2x5 pin connector), drawing 10mA from the -12V rail and 120mA from the +12V rail. The red stripe of the ribbon cable must be oriented on the same side as the \"Red stripe\" marking on the printed circuit board. About Granular synthesis Clouds continuously records the incoming audio into a short amount of sample memory. While recording time can reach up to 8s by reducing the audio quality setting, you ought to feel very guilty every time you think of this as \"tape\" - think of it as a space, a room. Using this recorded audio data, the module synthesizes a sonic texture by playing back short (overlapping) segments of audio (also known as \"grains\") extracted from it. Clouds allows you to control: From which part of the buffer the grains are taken. How long the grains are. At which speed/pitch the grains are replayed. How much overlap there is between the grains (density). Whether the distribution of grains in time is constant or random. Which envelope curve is applied to the grains - giving the impression of a \"rough\" or \"smooth\" texture. In addition, to create textures with a \"blurry\" feel, a diffuser (network of all-pass filters - like a reverb without tail) can be applied. The module plays grains continuously, at a rate determined by the DENSITY and SIZE settings. A trigger input is also present, to explicitly instruct the module to start the playback of a new grain. The maximum number of concurrent grains is quite large - between 40 and 60. This specificity brings Clouds closer to the roots of granular synthesis, and allows the synthesis of varied textures even from basic waveforms - there's indeed many more dimensions to granular synthesis than keeping a playback pointer moving through a SD-card sample! It is possible, at any time, to FREEZE the audio buffer from which the grains are taken - In this case, the incoming audio is no longer recorded. Somehow, Clouds is the exact opposite of a sampler: by default, the module always samples the audio it receives, except when it is in the frozen state. Front panel Controls A. FREEZE button. This latching button stops the recording of incoming audio. Granularization is now performed on the last few seconds of audio kept in memory in the module. B . Blending parameter/Audio quality button. Selects which of the blending parameters is controlled by the BLEND knob and CV input, or selects one of the four audio quality settings. C . Load/Save button. See the \"Advanced topics\" section. D . Grain POSITION . Selects from which part of the recording buffer the audio grains are played. Turn the knob clockwise to travel back in time. E. F. Grain SIZE and PITCH (transposition). At 12 o'clock, the buffer is played at its original frequency. G. Audio INPUT GAIN , from -18dB to +6dB. H. Grain DENSITY . At 12 o'clock, no grains are generated. Turn clockwise and grains will be sown randomly, counter-clockwise and they will be played at a constant rate. The further you turn, the higher the overlap between grains. I. Grain TEXTURE . Morphs through various shapes of grain envelopes: square (boxcar), triangle, and then Hann window. Past 2 o'clock, activates a diffuser which smears transients. J. BLEND knob. This multi-function knob is described in the Blending parameters section. K. Indicator LEDs. They work as an input vu-meter. When FREEZE is active, they monitor the output level. Soft-clipping occurs when the last LED is on. They can also indicate the quality setting (red), the function assigned to the BLEND knob (green), or the value of the four blending parameters (multicolor). Inputs and outputs All CV inputs are calibrated for a range of +/- 5V. Voltages outside of this range are tolerated, but will be clamped. 1. FREEZE gate input. When the input gate signal is high, stops the recording of incoming audio, just as latching the FREEZE button would do. 2. TRIGGER input. Generates a single grain. By moving the grain DENSITY to 12 o'clock, and sending a trigger to this input, Clouds can be controlled like a micro-sample player. An LFO or clock divider (or even a pressure plate) can thus be used to sow grains at the rate of your choice. 3. 4. Grain POSITION and SIZE CV inputs. 5. Grain transposition ( PITCH ) CV input, with V/Oct response. 6. BLEND CV input. This CV input can control one of the following functions depending on the active blending parameter: dry/wet balance, grain stereo spread, feedback amount and reverb amount. 7. 8. Stereo audio input. When no patch cable is inserted in the right channel input, this input will receive the signal from the left channel. 9. 10. Grain DENSITY and TEXTURE CV inputs. 11. 12. Stereo audio output. Blend parameters The BLEND knob can control one of these four settings: Dry/wet balance. Stereo spread (amount of random panning/balance applied to the grains). Feedback amount. Reverberation amount. To select which parameter is controlled by the BLEND knob and the BLEND CV input, press the Blend parameter/Audio quality button. The current parameter is temporarily indicated by a green LED. When turning the BLEND knob, the color of the four status LEDs temporarily shows the value of the four blending parameters (from black when the parameter is set to its minimum value to green, yellow and then red for the maximum value). It could happen that the position of the knob does not match the value of the parameter - the curse of multi-function knobs! If this is the case, turning the BLEND knob clockwise (resp. counterclockwise) causes a small increase (resp. decrease) in the value of the parameter, and turning it further causes larger changes, until the value progressively catches up with the knob's position. There are a few things worth knowing about these settings: All settings are automatically saved, and will be restored the next time the module is powered on. Strange things happen when FREEZE is enabled. Because feedback/layering can no longer occur in the recording buffer (hey, it's frozen...), we route the output signal through delays and all-pass filters, and let the feedback build-up occur in this extra recording space - giving the sound a very reverb-like nature. Advanced topics Audio quality Hold the Blend parameter/Audio quality button for one second, then press it repeatedly to choose a recording quality. The current quality setting is indicated by a red LED. Note that Clouds' 8-bit is a lovely flavour of 8-bit: \u00b5-law companding. It sounds like a Cassette, or a Fairlight - less hiss, more distortion. Saving and loading buffers Up to 4 frozen audio buffers can be saved and reloaded. Along with the audio data itself, the quality settings and the processing mode are saved with it. To save the recording buffer in permanent memory: Hold the Load/Save button for one second. Press the Blend parameter/Audio quality button repeatedly to select one of the 4 memory slots. The selected slot is indicated by a blinking red LED. Press the Load/Save button to confirm. To load a recording buffer from permanent memory: Press the Load/Save button. Press the Blend parameter/Audio quality button repeatedly to select one of the 4 memory slots. The selected slot is indicated by a blinking green LED. Press the Load/Save button to confirm. If you press the Load/Save button by mistake, do not press any button for a few seconds and the module will return to its normal state. Tips and tricks If you need a noise source to randomize grain position or pitch, you could do worse than reusing one of the audio outputs. It's certainly not white noise, but it's random enough... Scratch and caress a sound by using a contact microphone or a touch strip to trigger grains and modify playback POSITION . Very dense clouds sound the best when at least one parameter (pitch or position) receives random modulations. Otherwise, the many identical \"echoes\" created by the repeating grains will sound like a very resonant feedback comb filter. Raw material like sawtooth or sine waves sound very good, especially with heavy random modulation. A fun exercise is to recreate the classic THX sound with a random source and a VCA. Send a very fast sequence of 3 or 4 notes to the V/O input, so that each grain (if sown randomly) randomly picks one of those notes. The result? A chord! Experiment with capturing many small fragments of sound by sending short pulses to FREEZE while a complex patch is being played through the audio input! Calibration procedure The module is factory-calibrated using precision voltage sources. Follow this procedure only if you want to compensate for inaccuracies in your CV sources, or if your module has lost its calibration settings following a fault or the installation of alternative firmware. To calibrate the unit: Disconnect all CV inputs. Connect the note CV output of a well-calibrated keyboard interface or MIDI-CV converter to the V/OCT input. Press the Load/save button, and while you hold it down, press the Blend parameter/Audio quality button. The first 2 LEDs will blink in orange. Play a C2 note, or send a 1V voltage from your CV source. Press the Load/Save button. The four LEDs will blink in orange. Play a C4 note, or send a 3V voltage from your CV source. Press the Load/Save push-button. Calibration is done! Firmware update procedure Unplug all CV inputs/outputs from the module. Connect the output of your audio interface/sound card to the IN L input. Power on your modular system with the FREEZE push-button pressed. The FREEZE LED will blink. Make sure that no additional sound (such as email notification sounds, background music etc.) from your computer will be played during the procedure. Make sure that your speakers/monitors are not connected to your audio interface - the noises emitted during the procedure are aggressive and can harm your hearing. On non-studio audio equipment (for example the line output from a desktop computer), you might have to turn up the gain to the maximum. When you are all set, play the firmware update file into the module. While the module receives data, the bargraph will show the signal level. Signal reception is optimal when two or three LEDs are lit. You can use the IN GAIN knob to boost or reduce the gain. When the end of the audio file is reached, the module automatically restarts - if it is not the case, please retry the procedure. In case the signal level is inadequate, the LEDs will blink in red. Press the FREEZE push-button and retry with a higher gain. If this does not help, please retry the procedure from another computer/audio interface, and make sure that no piece of equipment (equalizer, FX processor) is inserted in the signal chain. The infamous alternate modes In its tumultuous teenage years, Clouds tried to be everything, including a delay/pitch-shifter, a spectral processor, a projectionist and a cab driver in Rouen. This experimental code is still available in the module, by pressing the B button for 5 seconds until one of the LEDs glows in orange, and then repeatedly pressing the button to select one of 4 functions: (First LED lit) Granular processor (normal operation). (Second LED lit) Pitch shifter/time-stretcher. (Third LED lit) Looping delay. (Fourth LED lit) Spectral processor. These features are experimental, and the knobs might be reassigned to functions very different from what is printed on the panel. It is not recommended to use these alternate modes if you plan to let Tony Rolando come play with your system. Granular mode Home sweet home. Pitch-shifter/time-stretcher This mode is quite similar to the granular mode, except that it uses two overlapping grains synchronized with the most salient period of the sound. The grains are carefully spliced so that they mesh well with each other (a technique similar to the \"deglitching\" of early pitch-shifters). Modulating POSITION when recording is frozen will \"scrub\" through the audio buffer. Clouds' uses classic time-domain methods which are not suitable for polyphonic or percussive material (unless this percussive material is breakbeats and you liked Akai samplers. Then: smile). DENSITY creates a granular diffusion effect based on all-pass filters. TEXTURE acts as a low-pass/high-pass filter. SIZE controls the size of the overlapping windows used for pitch-shifting and time-stretching \u2013 from an extremely grainy \"drilling\" sound to smooth bits of loops. Sending a trigger to the TRIG input creates a clock-synchronized loop (when FREEZE is enabled) or stuttering effect \u2013 equivalent to applying a tempo-synchronized decaying envelope on the POSITION parameter. Looping delay The looping delay mode continuously plays back audio from the buffer without any kind of granularization. POSITION controls the distance between the playback head and the recording head (in other words, the delay time). Modulating POSITION will create effects similar to vinyl scratching or manual manipulation of tape. When FREEZE is activated, the content of the audio buffer is looped (stutter effect). POSITION controls the loop start and SIZE the loop duration. DENSITY creates a granular diffusion effect based on all-pass filters; and TEXTURE acts as a low-pass/high-pass filter. SIZE controls the size of the overlapping windows used for pitch-shifting \u2013 fully clockwise for a smooth result that might smear transients, fully counterclockwise for a grainy, almost ring-modulated sound. When FREEZE is enabled, sending a trigger on the TRIG input creates a clock-synchronized stuttering loop. Otherwise, the period of the trigger pulses sets the delay time \u2013 provided this delay is shorter than the recording buffer size. Spectral madness In this mode, the incoming signal is converted into \"frames\" of spectral data, that are stored, transformed, recombined, and resynthesized as a time-domain signal. POSITION selects into which buffer the audio is poured (when FREEZE is not active), or from which buffer the audio is synthesised (when FREEZE is active). For example, set POSITION to its minimum value. Press FREEZE . You get a first texture. Set POSITION to its maximum value. UNFREEZE . Wait for something else to happen in the incoming audio. Press FREEZE again. By moving POSITION you interpolate between the two textures which had been captured at the press of FREEZE . Depending on the quality settings there are 2 to 7 buffers laid out over the course of the POSITION knob. What the module does is crossfade between a \"wavetable\" of FFT slices. SIZE changes the coefficients of a polynomial that determines how frequencies are mapped between the analysis and synthesis buffers. It's like a 1-knob GRM Warp. Over the course of the knob it will do spectral shifting, but also spectral reversal. PITCH controls the transposition (pitch-shifting). DENSITY determines how results from the analyzer are passed to the resynthesizer. Below 12 o'clock, there's some increasing probability that a given FFT bin won't get updated, causing a kind of partial freeze. After 12 o'clock, adjacent analysis frames are increasingly merged together (like a low-pass filter in the amplitude each frequency bin). At extreme settings, random phase modulation is applied to smooth things - giving you different flavours of spectral muddling/reverb. TEXTURE does two things: below 12 o'clock, it increasingly quantizes the amplitudes of the spectral components, like a very low-bitrate audio file. After 12 o'clock, it increasingly weakens the strongest partials and amplifies the weakest ones. This has the effect of making the spectrum more noise-like. Sending a trigger to the TRIG input creates various frequency-domain glitches typical of corrupted (encoded) audio files. It works as a kind of build-up/feedback effect - the shorter the pulse, the smaller the effect. With a continuous gate, it'll really start to rot.","title":"Manual"},{"location":"modules/clouds/manual/#overview","text":"Clouds is a granular audio processor. It creates textures and soundscapes by combining multiple overlapping, delayed, transposed and enveloped segments of sound taken from an audio recording buffer. Clouds differs from other granular Eurorack modules in that it focuses on the real-time processing of audio sources from your modular system itself, rather than the playback of pre-recorded samples from a storage device. It rewards the freezing, fragmentation and dissolution of the unexpected instant, rather than the careful planning of what might very well not come.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"modules/clouds/manual/#installation","text":"Clouds is designed for Eurorack synthesizer systems and occupies 18 HP of space.

The red stripe of the ribbon cable must be oriented on the same side as the \"Red stripe\" marking on the printed circuit board.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"modules/clouds/manual/#about-granular-synthesis","text":"Clouds continuously records the incoming audio into a short amount of sample memory. While recording time can reach up to 8s by reducing the audio quality setting, you ought to feel very guilty every time you think of this as \"tape\" - think of it as a space, a room. Using this recorded audio data, the module synthesizes a sonic texture by playing back short (overlapping) segments of audio (also known as \"grains\") extracted from it. Clouds allows you to control: From which part of the buffer the grains are taken. How long the grains are. At which speed/pitch the grains are replayed. How much overlap there is between the grains (density). Whether the distribution of grains in time is constant or random. Which envelope curve is applied to the grains - giving the impression of a \"rough\" or \"smooth\" texture. In addition, to create textures with a \"blurry\" feel, a diffuser (network of all-pass filters - like a reverb without tail) can be applied. The module plays grains continuously, at a rate determined by the DENSITY and SIZE settings. A trigger input is also present, to explicitly instruct the module to start the playback of a new grain. The maximum number of concurrent grains is quite large - between 40 and 60. This specificity brings Clouds closer to the roots of granular synthesis, and allows the synthesis of varied textures even from basic waveforms - there's indeed many more dimensions to granular synthesis than keeping a playback pointer moving through a SD-card sample! It is possible, at any time, to FREEZE the audio buffer from which the grains are taken - In this case, the incoming audio is no longer recorded. Somehow, Clouds is the exact opposite of a sampler: by default, the module always samples the audio it receives, except when it is in the frozen state.","title":"About Granular synthesis"},{"location":"modules/clouds/manual/#front-panel","text":"","title":"Front panel"},{"location":"modules/clouds/manual/#controls","text":"A.

Strange things happen when FREEZE is enabled.

Very dense clouds sound the best when at least one parameter (pitch or position) receives random modulations. Otherwise, the many identical \"echoes\" created by the repeating grains will sound like a very resonant feedback comb filter. Raw material like sawtooth or sine waves sound very good, especially with heavy random modulation. A fun exercise is to recreate the classic THX sound with a random source and a VCA. Send a very fast sequence of 3 or 4 notes to the V/O input, so that each grain (if sown randomly) randomly picks one of those notes. The result? A chord!

The module draws 5mA from both the +12V and the -12V supply rails.","title":"Installation"},{"location":"modules/ears/manual/#controls-inputs-and-outputs","text":"A. Gain control, 0 to +40dB. This large gain ranges covers everything - from the amplification of line-level instruments, to the magnification of tiny sonic details captured by external contact microphones. B. Contact microphone. Scratch, tap, rub, brush... to your heart's delight. 1. Hi-Z Audio input. Amplifies an external source. Patching a cable here disconnects the contact microphone. 2. Audio output. The red LED indicates clipping. 3. Envelope CV output. The white LED indicates the envelope CV level. 4. Gate output. Emits +8V when the envelope exceeds a threshold.
